# We let the model do the optimal variable selection and as you can see it reflects the real world facts about the two regions.
# By getting pretty good testing results we believe we are going in the right direction.
# Extracting appropriate data is crucial and we were successful in doing so. 

# Future work and recommendations:
# 1) Adding more variables,
# 2) Improving the accuracy of variable selection, and 
# 3) Improving Logistic Regression accuracy.
# Finally, we strongly believe a robust Logistic Regression model will help in understanding wildfire!
